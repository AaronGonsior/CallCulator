bug:
- in iterative search: condition of risk profile messes up gradient decent, big time

sols:
- make Huellkurve and implement idealistic optimum using idealistic huellkurve and perhaps then search in that area.
For mispricings, make list of options differing to the ideal huellkurve more than a threshold and comparing those.
Way to find huellkurve through least squares for example?

ToDo:
- implement LeastSquare() with tolerance and document in latex (later: ideal huellkurve)
