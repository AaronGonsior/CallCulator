bug:
- CAGR wrong
- put slope wrong factor *-1

sols:
- put wrong: removed math.abs() from 1/call.factor in PrintMathematicaCode()
- CAGR wrong: changed debug=true. Pay attention to yearsToExpiry etc.
- make Huellkurve and implement idealistic optimum using idealistic huellkurve and perhaps then search in that area.
For mispricings, make list of options differing to the ideal huellkurve more than a threshold and comparing those.
Way to find huellkurve through least squares for example?

ToDo:
- implement LeastSquare() with tolerance and document in latex (later: ideal huellkurve)
